Step 1: Create a variable to hold the first set of elements
var firstSet = [/* elements in the first set */];

Step 2: Create a variable to hold the second set of elements
var secondSet = [/* elements in the second set */];

 Step 3: Traverse through the first set, checking elements that are inside the first but not in the second set
for (var element in firstSet) {
    if (!(element in secondSet)) {
    Process or store the element as needed
    }
}

Step 4: Traverse through the second set, checking elements that are inside the second but not in the first set
for (var element in secondSet) {
    if (!(element in firstSet)) {
     Process or store the element as needed
    }
}

Step 5: Create a variable called sum
var sum = 0;

Step 6: Add all the distinct elements and store in the sum variable
var distinctElements = [...new Set([...firstSet, ...secondSet])];
for (var element in distinctElements) {
    sum += element;
}

Step 7: Print the result
